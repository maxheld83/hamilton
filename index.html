<p>The Secretary, after mature reflection on this point, entertains a full conviction, that an assumption of the debts of the particular states by the union, and a like provision for them, as for those of the union, will be a measure of sound policy and substantial justice.</p>

<p>Alexander Hamilton, first US treasury secretary, 14 January 1790</p>

<p>Welfare states are best understood as mixed economies, where free market exchange is supplemented by planned state command in the service of equity, efficiency, or both.</p>

<p>In well-designed mixed economies, market and plan co-exist with minimal mutual distortions, and democratic sovereigns can trade off efficiency and equity at relatively small marginal cost.
Intact mixed economies rely on a set of regulatory, monetary and fiscal tools that operate on the same scale as markets.</p>

<p>In negative integration, markets expand to larger scale, but states remain organized at lower levels, crippling the command tools of the mixed economy.
As a result, democratic sovereigns can no longer take primacy over the economy and any remaining welfare states will be inefficient, inequitable, unsustainable or all.</p>

<p>European integration is negative integration, and much of the 2010ff Euro-crises and the demise of European welfare states can be fruitfully analyzed as defunct mixed economies.</p>

<p>CEEC, in particular, followed a bad route to liberalization and built largely dysfunctional welfare states, because they did not, and could not, engage the trade-offs and contradictions of mixed economies in the context of negative integration.</p>

<p>Some of the existing literature on CEEC welfare and retrenchment fails to acknowledge the true constraints and alternatives of a mixed economy, and thereby fails to criticize and explain the societal and political choice of negative integration.</p>

<p>The current acquis threatens welfare, and, ultimately democracy and regional integration.
If the EU is to succeed, more economic integration must again always beget more political integration.</p>
